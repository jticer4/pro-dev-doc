		<h5>My Reflections:</h5>
			<p><strong>Week 0:</strong> My first week here at Deep Dive has been amazing! It's
			so nice to get to know everybody and see all of the different personalities. This week started out
			with some review on creating and deploying to repositories. We then learned about creating personas and use/case
			interaction flows. It was really fun to work in groups while designing our personas. We then moved on to
			databases and learned about their entities, and their corresponding attributes. We then  learned about Entity Relationship Diagrams, foreign/primary keys and some commands in mySQL. </p>
