		<h4>Career Buddy: Erik Clevenger</h4>
		<h4>My Learning Style:</h4>
		<ul>

		<h4>Qualitative Features About Myself:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Empathetic: I can be very sensitive to peoples needs, this allows me to be more cooperative. The downside of being empathetic
			is that sometimes you can have a soft spot for people who don't deserve it.</li>
			<li>Intuitive: Makes it easier for me to read between the lines. This can be emotionally exhausting. Makes it easier to get caught up in other people's needs.</li>
			<li>Persistent: Allows me to hammer away at problems without giving up. However, it can sometimes be easy to
			get caught up in the details, without considering a more global perspective.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>My Golden Circle:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Why? I want to be able to improve people's quality of life.</li>
			<li>How? By taking everyday activities and making them easier, and more fun, in order to increase people's engagement.</li>
			<li>What? I plan on making web applications and smart devices to allow people to take new approaches to old problems.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>My Elevator Pitch:</h4>
		<p>Hi my name is James. I build devices and applications designed to take a new approach to boring, routine tasks. This is to reduce wasted time and allow people to focus on what really matters most. What are you sick of doing?</p>

		<h4>My Reflections:</h4>
			<p><strong>Week 0:</strong> My first week here at Deep Dive has been amazing! It's
			so nice to get to know everybody and see all of the different personalities. This week started out
			with some review on creating and deploying to repositories. We then learned about creating personas and use/case
			interaction flows. It was really fun to work in groups while designing our personas. We then moved on to
			databases and learned about their entities, and their corresponding attributes. We then  learned about Entity Relationship Diagrams, foreign/primary keys and some commands in mySQL. </p>
